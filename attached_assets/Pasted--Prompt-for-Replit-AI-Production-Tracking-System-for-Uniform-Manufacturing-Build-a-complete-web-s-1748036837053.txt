 Prompt for Replit AI – Production Tracking System for Uniform Manufacturing

Build a complete web system (frontend + backend) to manage the production of uniform batches in a small factory. Focus on core functionality and clean UI — I need to save credits, so please avoid unnecessary code and comments.

🛠 Tech stack suggestion:

Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js + Express

Use in-memory data or a simple db.json to simulate the database

📁 Modules to include:

Product Registration

Fields: name, internal reference (code), technical description, main fabric (type + required meters per piece), list of notions (e.g., label, elastic, zipper, button — with quantity per unit), and optional notes (e.g., size variations).

Production Batches

Auto-generated batch code

Related product

Number of items

Cut date

Status: waiting, sent to internal production, sent to external workshop, returned (checked or with issues)

Assigned workshop (if applicable)

Dates: sent to production, expected return, actual return

Conference result: OK, Problem (requires notes)

Observations

History of status changes (who updated and when)

Image upload for the cut batch (e.g., photo of fabric stacks)

Workshop Registration

Name, person in charge, phone, address, service type (sewing, embroidery, finishing), optional estimated capacity

Users & Access

Username, role (admin, production supervisor, cutter), permission level (view, register, edit)

📊 Main Dashboard

Weekly calendar view (Sunday to Saturday)

Each batch appears as a colored horizontal bar spanning from the cut date to return date

Inside each bar: batch code + workshop name

Color-coded by workshop

Clicking on a batch opens a pop-up with all batch details + history

📂 Filters:

Filter by product, workshop, status, or date range

📸 Additional features:

Upload and view batch image (e.g. stacked cut fabric)

Track batch movement history with user + timestamp

Simple production report by period, product, or workshop

🖼️ Note: I will upload an image that shows the desired dashboard layout for the weekly calendar view. Please follow that visual layout closely when building the dashboard UI.

Include mock data: 2 products, 2 workshops, and 3 example batches with distinct statuses and dates to simulate full functionality.
